## Introduction

This data-set pertains to scores obtained by students in diverse subjects. Family Income is also part of this data-set.

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(skimr)
library(ggformula)
library(GGally)
library(easystats) 
library(correlation)
```

## Playing with and understanding the data

### Acquiring the data:

```{r}
#| label: Read the data
scores <- read_csv("../../data/school-scores-data.csv")
scores
```

```{r}
glimpse(scores)
```

The data doesn't seem right. How are there 99 columns?

> Use the `janitor` package here to clean up the variable names. Try to use the `big_camel` case name format for variables.

```{r}
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
scores_cleaned <- clean_names(scores, case = "big_camel")
scores_cleaned
```

```{r}
glimpse(scores_cleaned)
```

```{r}
skim(scores_cleaned)
```

Should i try plotting histograms? There are way too many variables to do it for tho.

#### Observations:

1.  The variables Year, StateCode, and StateName are qualitative (categorical) data but they have a large number of unique levels, meaning they can't be treated as factors. Maybe Year can be? It only have 10 different levels.
2.  Rest all variables are quantitative either representing average GPA, number of students or average score.
3.  There are no missing values for any variable.

### Target and Predictor Variables:

The target variables could be either the **Math** score (TotalMath) or the **Verbal** score (TotalVerbal). You could treat them as separate target variables or focus on just one. Leaving the rest of the variables to be predictor variables.

## Defining the Research Experiment:

The primary goal of this research could be to predict **test scores** (in both math and verbal sections) based on various demographic, socioeconomic, and academic factors.

**Demographics: To understand regional and gender-based differences in education outcomes.**

-   `StateCode`, `StateName` (location-related factors)

-   `GenderFemaleTestTakers`, `GenderMaleTestTakers` (gender of the test-takers)

**Socioeconomic Variables: Assess how financial background impacts test performance.**

-   `FamilyIncomeLessThan20KTestTakers`, `FamilyIncomeBetween20_40KTestTakers`, etc. (family income)

-   `FamilyIncomeLessThan20KMath`, `FamilyIncomeBetween20_40KMath`, etc. (scores for different income levels)

**Academic Background: To understand the relationship between day-to-day academic success and standardized testing success.**

-   `GpaAMinusTestTakers`, `GpaBTestTakers`, etc. (number of test-takers with specific GPAs)

-   `AcademicSubjectsArtsMusicAverageGpa` (average GPA in academic subjects)

Why do it? To identify which factors have the most significant influence on standardized test scores.

Use: By understanding the factors influencing standardized test performance could help education policymakers identify gaps in achievement and support more equitable access to resources.

Questions:

1.  Does a higher family income correlate with better test scores.
2.  Do students with higher GPAs perform better on standardized tests.
3.  Do certain states consistently outperform others. If yes, does this relate to it's socioeconomic status or educational policies.
4.  Does gender plays a role in performance differences.

## Graph 1:

![](images/clipboard-2380202343.png)

Type of graph: a Scatter Plot analyzing the visible relationships between different Quantitative variables using GGally.

### Defining the question:

1.  Are there patterns of performance consistency or variation between subjects?
2.  What is the Correlation between the average GPA of different subjects? Is being good / bad in one subject mean they are good/bad at all?

### Analyse the Data:

Identifying the variables used: The quantitative values under all AcademicSubjects"*Subject*"AverageGpa's quantitative data are plotted against each other. There is no particular data transformation required other than changing the variable names and cleaning the data-set a little more to only have these variables (although neither of these are really necessary)

```{r}
#| label: Transforming the data
scores_modified <- scores_cleaned %>%
  rename(
    ArtsMusic = AcademicSubjectsArtsMusicAverageGpa,
    English = AcademicSubjectsEnglishAverageGpa,
    ForeignLanguages = AcademicSubjectsForeignLanguagesAverageGpa,
    Mathematics = AcademicSubjectsMathematicsAverageGpa,
    NaturalSciences = AcademicSubjectsNaturalSciencesAverageGpa,
    SocialSciencesHistory = AcademicSubjectsSocialSciencesHistoryAverageGpa
    )%>%
  select(ArtsMusic, English, ForeignLanguages, Mathematics,NaturalSciences, SocialSciencesHistory)
scores_modified
```

Analyzing it:

```{r}
scores_modified %>%
  gf_histogram(~ArtsMusic)

scores_modified %>%
  gf_histogram(~English)

scores_modified %>%
  gf_histogram(~ForeignLanguages)

scores_modified %>%
  gf_histogram(~Mathematics)

scores_modified %>%
  gf_histogram(~NaturalSciences)

scores_modified %>%
  gf_histogram(~SocialSciencesHistory)
```

All graphs have a kind of a bimodial dirstibution. Art and music seems to have a very left skewed. Majority of the data points are concentrated on the lower end of the scale, with fewer high values. Natual science and Social science and history seems to have very similar distributions, which English and Foreign languages seem to have similar ones.

### Replicating the graph:

```{r}
GGally::ggpairs(
  scores_modified %>% drop_na(),
  # Select Quant variables only for now
  columns = c(
    "ArtsMusic", "English", "ForeignLanguages", "Mathematics", "NaturalSciences", "SocialSciencesHistory"
  ),
  switch = "both",
  progress = FALSE,
  diag = list(continuous = "densityDiag"),
  lower = list(continuous = wrap("smooth", alpha = 0.03, se = FALSE)),
  title = "Academic Scores in Different Subjects"
)
```

### **Doing a Correlation Test:**

```{r}
cor_results <- correlation::correlation(scores_modified)
cor_results
```

#### Observations:

All combination of subjects have a very small range of confidence intervals. Therefore, all correlation scores are valid i.e. all relationships are statistically significant, reliable, and consistent.

### Observations:

1.  There is a high positive correlation between all subjects.
2.  This consistent positive correlation might indicate that students who perform well in one subject tend to perform well in others. This could suggest a general academic competence or factors like study habits, discipline, or access to resources influencing performance across all subjects.
3.  The correlation between ArtsMusic and Mathematics is relatively lower (0.878) compared to the other subject pairs but still strong. This could highlight different skill sets, as Arts/Music may engage creativity, whereas Mathematics is more focused on logical reasoning
4.  English and Foreign Languages (0.964): These subjects may require similar skills in language comprehension, grammar, and communication.
5.  Social Sciences/History and English (0.982) & Natural Science and Social Sciences/History(0.985) & English and Natural Science(0.980): All 3 subjects subjects rely heavily on reading, writing, and critical analysis, which might explain the very high correlation.
6.  With mathematics, the subject with highest correlation is NaturalSciences with a score of 0.977. Both subjects share analytical and logical reasoning skills, which could explain the strong link.

## Graph 2:

![](images/clipboard-12188771.png)

Type of graph: A box plot.

### Defining the question:

Does a higher family income correlate with better test scores?

### Analyse the Data:

Type of variables: Where a quantitative data (math scores) is plotted as a box plot separated by "levels" of income earned by the family. In this existing data-set, all math scores categorized by income are in different rows (FamilyIncomeBetween"*Number1-Number2*"KMath). We need to make a new column called **IncomeCategory** with the different levels of income and another that corresponds with it called **Values** where the math score data is stored.

```{r}
income_data <- scores_cleaned %>%
  select(
    FamilyIncomeBetween20_40KMath,
    FamilyIncomeLessThan20KMath,
    FamilyIncomeBetween40_60KMath,
    FamilyIncomeBetween60_80KMath,
    FamilyIncomeBetween80_100KMath,
    FamilyIncomeMoreThan100KMath
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = everything(),
    names_to = "IncomeCategory",
    values_to = "Value"
  ) %>%
  mutate(IncomeCategory = case_when(
    IncomeCategory == "FamilyIncomeLessThan20KMath" ~ "LessThan20K",
    IncomeCategory == "FamilyIncomeBetween20_40KMath" ~ "Between20_40K",
    IncomeCategory == "FamilyIncomeBetween40_60KMath" ~ "Between40_60K",
    IncomeCategory == "FamilyIncomeBetween60_80KMath" ~ "Between60_80K",
    IncomeCategory == "FamilyIncomeBetween80_100KMath" ~ "Between80_100K",
    IncomeCategory == "FamilyIncomeMoreThan100KMath" ~ "MoreThan100K",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_,
  )) %>%
  select(IncomeCategory, Value)%>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    IncomeCategory = factor(IncomeCategory,
      levels = c("LessThan20K", "Between20_40K", "Between40_60K","Between60_80K", "Between80_100K", "MoreThan100K" ),
      labels = c("LessThan20K", "Between20_40K", "Between40_60K","Between60_80K", "Between80_100K", "MoreThan100K"),
      ordered = TRUE
    )
  )

income_data
```

> #### What is `pivot_longer()`?
>
> -   **Wide Format**: This format typically has multiple columns representing different variables. For example, each family income category might have its own column for math scores.
>
> -   **Long Format**: This format consolidates these variables into two columns: one for the variable names (e.g., income categories) and one for their corresponding values. This format is often easier to work with for data analysis and visualization.

Analyzing the variables:

```{r}
income_data %>% count(IncomeCategory)
```

It was dumb of my to not realize it before, obviously they are going to have the same count of values for each, they were individual columns before.

### Replicating the graph:

```{r}
income_data %>%
  gf_boxplot(reorder(IncomeCategory, Value, FUN = median) ~ Value,
    fill = ~IncomeCategory,
    alpha = 0.2
  ) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Math Scores vs Family Income",subtitle = "Chart 2" ) %>%
  gf_labs(
    x = "Scores in Math",
    y = "Income Class"
  )
```

#### Observations:

1.  There is a **positive correlation** between family income and math scores. As family income increases, median math scores also increase, showing that students from higher-income families tend to score better in math.
2.  There are several **outliers** in the lower-income categories (especially for "LessThan20K" and "Between20_40K") with students scoring exceptionally higher than their peers.
3.  "LessThan20K" seems to have a couple of outliers at 0. Did a lot of students not show up for tests? It's interesting to see that other than them, only "Between20_40K" and "MoreThan100K" have students with a score of 0.
4.  The chart illustrates that higher family income is associated with better math scores, with less variation in performance as income increases. However, even in lower-income groups, some students perform as well as those from higher-income families.

## My Story:

I will admit i was overwhelmed by the amount of data (in particular the amount of columns in this data set. After a small panic, when i did do through all of it. I realized it was not as scary as it looked, it was more or less comrehendable and i did get the hang of it.

Thank you so much for the clues on how i could clean the data. I don't think i would have been able to move forward without it. After i figured that out, doing the correlation graph was pretty straight forward. Now that i think about it, maybe i didn't really have to change the column names for it to appear the same as in your graph, maybe there was another way to go about doing it.

The second graph that was a lot more tricky compared to the first. While not the plot itself, it was more the preparing and transforming the data (like creating a new column called **IncomeCategory** with the different levels of income and another that corresponds with it called **Values** where the math score data is stored) that was hard. I didn't know a lot of things i used to do it, before i did it - like pivot_long and even select. I realised how much you can learn by simply trying.

And like always i enjoyed finding inferences. I think this will always be my favorite part.
